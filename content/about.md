Experienced software engineer skilled in creating, deploying and maintaining cloud-based distributed software systems.

Before being a software engineer I've worked closely with software developers as a business analyst and possess a keen understanding of the software development and delivery process.

As a software developer I work with cross-functional teams, polyglot codebases, and cloud-hosted service-based architectures. I am accustomed to leading initiatives across teams, and owning the automation and deployment tooling of the codebases built by my teams.

Software projects I have worked on have included -
- Red Had Openshift Apache Kafka (RHOSAK), an Apache Kafka-based managed service
- Red Hat Managed Integrations (RHMI), a SaaS-based integration suite based on 3Scale Api Management, AMQ messaging, and Fuse integrations delivered on managed OpenShift
- Aerogear Mobile Security Service, a fullstack security service to allow the management of mobile applications remotely
- Red Hat Mobile Application Platform (RHMAP), an on-premise and SaaS-based platform to support the building and management of mobile applications

Tech stacks I've worked with include:
- Java, Python, Golang, Bash, Node.js, React.js, Android, AWS, Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins

I work equally well remotely or office-based, and outside my day to day job I enjoy keeping up with the latest developments in tech, volunteering in educational outreach programmes, keeping fit and healthy, and exploring creative hobbies.

Building out end to end software applications excites me, and I love to be involved in a project from development to deployment and management in production.
