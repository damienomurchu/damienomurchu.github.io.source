# Open Source

As a software developer I work with, and rely upon open source software daily, yet see a lot of confusion about it amongst those unfamiliar with it. Moreover I've seen many of those in software fail to describe open source to others, at least to my satisfaction. This article is my attempt to rectify that.

## What is it?

Defintions can be tricky, so let me start by looking at what open source tends to look like in the software world. 

In the software world, open source commonly refers to software code. This code written by programmers is hosted in online public code repositories and is free for anyone to use, as long as they respect the terms laid out by the license agreement bundled with the code. 

Various types of open source license exist, and typically concern themselves with x, y, and z. In practice there are a couple of common ones, and sites like []() make it easy to choose the right one for you if open sourcing any of your own code.

Open source does not have to relate specifically to code, and to me open source is more a philosophy whereby something is created, out out there for public use, with some mechanisms to prevent abuse.

## Why

Two central tenets of software development tend to be not re-inventing the wheel when not required, and focussing yoru efforts on the areas you can provide value.

Open source compliments this perfectly by providing pre-built units of code that can be shared and re-used, and allowing software developers to focus their skills and efforts on the areas where they can provide unique value. 

These benefits are quite compelling, however I would like to add a few I don't see others talk about too much.

The first is iteration speed - by being able to make use of prebuilt units of code, it can make bootstrapping a project and developing an MVP much quicker. In a complex and changing world it is often vital to get your product out there early to receive valuable feedback to refine and iterate upon your product offering. Remember in many industries, ideas mean nothing, but rather the speed and execution of the idea.

Secondly - more eyeballs. By opening your creation to a wider audience you dramatically increase the amount of potential feedback and contribution you may receive. You can literally stand on the shoulders of giants and produce the best possible version of your creation with the input of others. More eyeballs = potential quality increases.

## Drawbacks

Open source is not without any drawbacks. Just because something has been developed and put out there publicly is no guarantee to its quality. Also, documentation is often very poor. Sometimes projects are abandoned.

## Summing up

I hope I've helped ease some of the confusion as to what open source is. I also hope I've helped show how open source is not something simply related to software, but rather an approach to collaboration which can be used in many other areas.
