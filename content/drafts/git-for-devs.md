# Git for devs

I have many friends entering the software industry. None use version control. They will need to, probably before anything else. This is an article for them, and also the article I wish I'd found when starting out.

## Git?

Git is a version control system. Effectively it means history - you can save the state of your code at any point, and navigate back to it at a later point. This usually means when you screw up you can get back to a known working state easily. Git offers more but we can chat about that later. 

## Terminology

- repo: your folder of code under version control
- commit: the state of your code at a specific point
- remote: a cloud-hosted copy of your repo


## Setup

To start using git you will need:
- git installed on your computer
- basic config setup

This is all you will need to version control your code on your local machine. To use github you will need:
- a github account
- a key (optional, but recommended)
