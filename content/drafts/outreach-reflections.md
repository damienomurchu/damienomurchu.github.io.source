# Outreach 

Outreach can be defined both as reaching further and also efforts to reach out to the community. I agree with both definitions, and being involved with outreach programmes for 12 months it seemed a good time to reflect on my experiences and observations in that time.

# Beginnings

My initial involvement with outreach programmes began with a local chapter of the [CoderDojo movement]() and grew to becoming involved with several outreach initiatives with Red Hat Mobile as they instigated efforts to reach out to the community. CoderDojo and these initiatives have typically involved working with children between 8- 15, teaching and helping them learn programming.

# Benefits

- chance to explore teaching
- opportunity to organise a curriculum
- opportunity to pay a little forward. I'm a great believer in helping others whenever I can, this gave me one such opportunity to do so.
- opportunity to focus on the fundamental aspects of software development
- allowed me become involved in screening interviews of interns
- refresher on fundamentals


# Drawbacks

- low attention span of students
- lot of fundamentals to teach to kids first
- difficulty in transitioning to more advanced materials

# Open questions

- made me ask is this how I can best contribute
- is this the best way to contribute?
