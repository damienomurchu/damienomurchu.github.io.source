# Unified Push Server (UPS) on OpenShift  

## Prerequisites

You should have a locally installed version of OpenShift, or access to an OpenShift cluster. If you don't have either, you can set up your own OpenShift local cluster by reading this [document]({{ "/hero-openshift" | relative_url }}).

## Bringing up your cluster

Bring up your cluster with:  
`oc cluster up --public-hostname=127.0.0.1 --host-data-dir=$HOME/os/data-dir --host-config-dir=$HOME/os/config-dir`  

![oc-cluster-up][oc-cluster-up]  

## Log into your cluster

Log into your cluster via `oc login`

![oc-login][oc-login]  

## Deploy MySQL containers

We will be using the UPS docker image from Docker Hub. This image requires that we have 2 MySQL instances named 'unifiedpush'  and 'keycloak'. Create these by:  

* `oc new-app mysql MYSQL_USER=unifiedpush MYSQL_PASSWORD=unifiedpush MYSQL_DATABASE=keycloak --name=keycloak`  

![deploy-mysql-keycloak][deploy-mysql-keycloak]  

* `oc new-app mysql MYSQL_USER=unifiedpush MYSQL_PASSWORD=unifiedpush MYSQL_DATABASE=unifiedpush --name=unifiedpush`  

![deploy-mysql-unified-push][deploy-mysql-unified-push]  

Confirm that both MySQL instances have come online by checking the OpenShift console, or via the terminal with `oc status`.  

![pod-keycloak][pod-keycloak]  
![pod-unifiedpush][pod-unifiedpush]  

## Deploy AeroGear UPS

With both required MySQL instances installed and running, UPS can now be deployed by running the following command in your terminal:

    oc new-app aerogear/unifiedpush-wildfly \ 
    UNIFIEDPUSH_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR=unifiedpush \ 
    UNIFIEDPUSH_PORT_3306_TCP_PORT=3306 \ 
    UNIFIEDPUSH_ENV_MYSQL_DATABASE=unifiedpush \ 
    KEYCLOAK_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR=keycloak \ 
    KEYCLOAK_PORT_3306_TCP_PORT=3306 \ 
    KEYCLOAK_ENV_MYSQL_DATABASE=keycloak \ 
    UNIFIEDPUSH_ENV_MYSQL_USER=unifiedpush \ 
    UNIFIEDPUSH_ENV_MYSQL_PASSWORD=unifiedpush \ 
    KEYCLOAK_ENV_MYSQL_USER=unifiedpush \ 
    KEYCLOAK_ENV_MYSQL_PASSWORD=unifiedpush \ 
    --name=unifiedpush-wildfly  

![deploy-unifiedpush-wildfly][deploy-unifiedpush-wildfly]  
![pod-unifiedpush-wildfly][pod-unifiedpush-wildfly]  

This will deploy UPS and pass in the necessary environmental variables for UPS to pick up the MySQL instances. You can see these environmental variables in the OpenShift console:  

![deploy-unifiedpush-wildfly-env-vars][deploy-unifiedpush-wildfly-env-vars]  

## Exposing routes to UPS deployment

With UPS deployed, the final step is to expose route(s) so we can access our UPS instance through a web browser. The following creates 2 routes; one to access UPS through localhost on our web browser, and one through which the android emulator can access UPS:

* `oc expose service unifiedpush-wildfly --hostname=ups.127.0.0.1.nip.io --port=8080-tcp --name=ups-local-unsecured`
* `oc expose service unifiedpush-wildfly --hostname=ups.10.0.2.2.nip.io --port=8080-tcp --name=ups-android-unsecured`

You should see confirmation that the routes have been created: 

![terminal-route-1][terminal-route-1]  
![terminal-route-2][terminal-route-2]  

The OpenShift console will confirm that this also:  

![pod-unifiedpush-wildfly-routes-2][pod-unifiedpush-wildfly-routes-2]  
![pod-unifiedpush-wildfly-routes-1][pod-unifiedpush-wildfly-routes-1]  

** if you require any other routes to be exposed to UPS for your apps, you can simply add them in the above manner. 

## Fixing Keycloak Linking
UPS uses an embedded Keycloak server to handle its authentication. Right now there is an issue when the UPS pod starts up it canâ€™t route to Keycloak using the public route. To work around this, do the following after the pod has loaded fully

* navigate to the unifiedpush-wildfly pod in the OpenShift web console

![applications-pods][applications-pods]  

* Run `wget http://localhost:8080/ag-push/index.html` in the Terminal for the unifiedpush-wildfly pod

![pod-unifiedpush-wildfly-terminal][pod-unifiedpush-wildfly-terminal]  


## Configuring UPS

UPS can now be configured via the browser and the route you have created:  

![browser-ups][browser-ups]  

* Click on the 'Administration Console' from the above WildFly landing page to bring you to the UPS front screen

![ups-front-screen][ups-front-screen]  

** This tutorial does not cover how to configure UPS to send push notifications to your mobile app. For guidance on how to do so, the AeroGear HelloPush tutorial may be found [here](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-android-cookbook/tree/master/HelloPush) which covers cover how to configure push notifications to an app with UPS.
